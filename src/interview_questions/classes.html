1. what is a Class, Object, Reference?
	
	Class: A class is a user defined data type with set of data members & member functions.
	Object: An Object is an instance of a class.
	Reference: A reference is just like a pointer pointing to an object.
	
2. What are the other ways to create an object other than creating as new object?
	
	1.class.forName: Classname obj = Class.forName("Class Name").newInstance();
	2.object.clone
	
1.Use Of Inner Class??

	Defining a class within another class allows you to *recursively* use OO concepts within smaller sub-problem of the main problem.
	Fundamentally, that's what a class is in OO. A class is created by the programmer to abstract out and solve a sub-problem of the larger main problem.
	However, any one of a programmer's defined classes can have its own inner nested structure.
	Defining inner classes that are completely enclosed in the outer class to solve its sub-problem is a recursive use of OO.
	
	Example: You may have class Car that also defines an inner class FuelPumpTypeA (abstraction) and that may extend an abstract global FuelPump type (polymorphism & inheritance).
	This FuelPumpType A can be defined privately and only ever used within class Car. You *could* have declared FuelPumpTypeA outside of Car but,
	if its never meant to be used outside of Car, you are are over-scoping FuelPumpTypeA. In general, you want to keep variable scope as tight as possible to have a clean design (encapsulation),
	this is the same thing but applied at the class level. Everyone knows that global variables are generally considered bad and should be avoided when possible.
	Same thing can be said of global classes that were never meant to be global. Private hidden inner classes are the most useful instance of inner classes IMO.
	FuelPumpTypeA within Car is a full class in its own right with full Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Inheritence. It was created to solve a sub-problem within class Car.
